To redirect a user to a specific website using HTML, you can use the <meta> tag or JavaScript. Here's an example:

Using the <meta> tag

This method redirects the user after a specific delay (e.g., 5 seconds):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5; url=https://www.example.com">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>You are being redirected to <a href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If the redirection does not happen automatically, please click the link above.</p>
</body>
</html>

Using JavaScript

This method redirects the user immediately when the page is loaded:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
    <script>
        // Redirect immediately
        window.location.href = "https://www.pornhub.com";
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p>You are being redirected to <a href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>

Explanation

Replace https://www.example.com with the URL you want to redirect the user to.

Use the <meta> tag for a timed redirection or JavaScript for instant redirection.
